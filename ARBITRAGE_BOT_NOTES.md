# LARPy - Implementation Notes

## Architecture Reflections

### What Was Built
- Extended the premade.py React agent with specialized tools for DEX arbitrage
- Created modular tool structure with three main components:
  - **Blockchain tools**: Direct interaction with Ethereum network
  - **DEX price tools**: Price fetching from Uniswap V3 and SushiSwap via direct contract calls
  - **Arbitrage analysis tools**: Opportunity detection and profit calculation

### Design Decisions

1. **Tool-based Architecture**: Used LangChain tools pattern for clean separation of concerns
2. **Direct Contract Calls**: Uses direct smart contract queries for reliability - no API keys needed
3. **Focus on Major Tokens**: Limited to well-audited, high-liquidity tokens to reduce risk
4. **Read-only POC**: Current implementation focuses on detection rather than execution

### Technical Improvements Made

1. **Uniswap V3**: Now uses the Quoter contract's `quoteExactInputSingle()` for accurate swap prices
2. **SushiSwap**: Uses `getReserves()` for AMM pool pricing
3. **Curve Finance**: Implemented CurveRouterNG with proper token index mapping for tricrypto pools
   - Correctly handles ETH/USDT and ETH/USDC via tricryptoUSDT and tricryptoUSDC pools
   - Falls back to `get_best_rate()` method for automatic routing
4. **No External APIs**: Removed 1inch API dependency due to authentication requirements
5. **Checksummed Addresses**: All addresses properly checksummed for web3.py compatibility
6. **Accurate Pricing**: Uses official router contracts for production-ready quotes

### Key Learnings

1. **API Limitations**: 
   - 1inch API may have rate limits without API key
   - The Graph now requires API keys for Uniswap/SushiSwap subgraphs
   - Direct contract calls are more reliable and don't require API keys
   - Public RPCs have reliability issues

2. **Gas Considerations**:
   - Gas costs significantly impact profitability
   - Need to factor in approval transactions
   - MEV protection is crucial for actual execution

3. **Improvements for Production**:
   - Add flashloan integration for capital efficiency
   - Implement MEV protection strategies
   - Use WebSocket connections for real-time price feeds
   - Add more DEXs (Curve, Balancer, etc.)
   - Implement actual transaction execution tools

### Security Considerations

- Never store private keys in code
- Use secure RPC endpoints for production
- Implement slippage protection
- Add circuit breakers for large trades
- Monitor for sandwich attacks

### Next Steps for V2

1. Add flashloan tools for capital-free arbitrage
2. Implement transaction execution with proper signing
3. Add real-time price monitoring via WebSockets
4. Create profit tracking and analytics
5. Add more sophisticated MEV protection
6. Implement multi-hop arbitrage paths
